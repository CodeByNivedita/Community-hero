# Community Hero - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 1.1

Project Type: AI-Powered Hyperlocal Civic Problem Solver

Hackathon: Community Hero – Hyperlocal Problem Solver

---

# 1. Executive Summary

Community Hero is an AI-powered civic engagement platform that enables citizens to report, verify, track, and help resolve local infrastructure and public service issues.

The platform combines Artificial Intelligence, geolocation, community participation, gamification, and real-time analytics to improve transparency and accountability between citizens and municipal authorities.

Unlike traditional complaint portals, Community Hero transforms citizens into active contributors by rewarding meaningful participation through experience points, badges, missions, and leaderboards.

Artificial Intelligence automatically analyzes uploaded images, categorizes issues, predicts severity, suggests the responsible department, detects duplicate reports, and provides actionable insights for authorities.

The platform is designed as a modern web application optimized for both desktop and mobile devices and will be deployed on Google Cloud via Firebase Hosting.

# 2. Vision

Create the smartest AI-powered civic engagement platform where every citizen becomes a Community Hero by helping identify, verify, and improve local infrastructure.

---

# 3. Problem Statement

Communities frequently experience civic issues such as:

* Potholes
* Water leakages
* Garbage accumulation
* Damaged streetlights
* Broken roads
* Drainage blockages
* Illegal dumping

Current reporting systems suffer from several limitations:

* Difficult reporting process
* Lack of transparency
* Duplicate complaints
* Slow response times
* Limited community participation
* No incentive for citizens
* Poor communication between authorities and citizens

As a result, citizens lose confidence in reporting problems and many issues remain unresolved.

---

# 4. Solution

Community Hero introduces an AI-powered reporting ecosystem.

Citizens upload an image or video.

Gemini AI automatically identifies:

* Issue category
* Severity
* Priority
* Confidence score
* Suggested government department

The issue is placed on a live community map.

Nearby citizens can physically verify the issue using GPS and live photo verification.

Municipal officers receive verified reports together with AI-generated summaries and update the issue status until resolution.

Citizens earn rewards for meaningful participation.

# 8. Core Modules & Features

## AI Image Analysis
Users upload images. Gemini Vision API automatically detects the Issue Type, Severity, Confidence Score, Priority, and Suggested Department.

## AI Duplicate Detection
Before a new report is finalized, Gemini AI and location data are used to flag potential duplicates within a close radius, preventing cluttered maps and redundant municipal work.

## Community Verification
Nearby citizens can visit reported locations. Verification requires GPS validation and a live photo upload. Successfully verified reports receive higher trust.

## Problem GO Style Location Missions
Nearby unverified issues become interactive missions for citizens (e.g., "Walk 150 meters to verify this pothole"). Completion rewards XP and badges.

## Rewards & XP System
Citizens earn XP, points, badges, levels, and streaks for reporting and verifying issues.

## Trust Score System
Users build a Trust Score based on the accuracy of their reports and verifications, making their future reports carry more weight in the system.

## Leaderboards
Weekly and all-time leaderboards encourage participation by displaying the most active "Community Heroes."

## Impact Dashboard
Visualizes community impact, such as Community Health Score, Resolution Rate, Heatmaps, Water Saved, Garbage Removed, Before & After Galleries, and AI Insights.

## Interactive Map
Displays all issues using Google Maps Platform. Supports filtering, heatmaps, search, navigation, and severity color-coding.

## AI Assistant
Citizens can ask the AI: "What should I verify today?", "Show nearby unresolved issues", "Why was my report rejected?", or "Which area needs help?"

## Municipality Workflow
A dedicated admin view for municipal officers to receive verified reports, manage statuses (e.g., In Progress, Resolved), and assign departments.

## Notifications
Firebase Cloud Messaging powers real-time alerts for issue updates, nearby missions, and level-ups.

## Admin Analytics
Dashboards for city officials to analyze reporting trends, departmental efficiency, and resource allocation.
